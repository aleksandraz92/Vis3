VIS Assignment 3


This assignment was really hard and I have also so much other stuff to do so I did just Tasks for Grade 4).
First of all I properly handle mutlitple plot layouts with help of #charts. Then I create a histogram bar chart to show how many Number of Recors  were per year.
Then I need to create a timeline Histogram, I was not sure what did you mean so I scale my X axes in 100 years ago and represent how many crimes were per year..
And at the end i need to create scateplot. For that i need one array with date and distance. For calculate distance I used a code from internet.
